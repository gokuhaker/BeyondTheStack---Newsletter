# BeyondTheStack---Newsletter
Beyond The Stack - My Newletter on LinkedIn. Practical insights and real-world takeaways on Java, Spring Boot, Cloud Engineering, and AI for curious developers.

21 years ago, I was building desktop apps with Java AWT & Swing.

Today, I’m writing prompts, training AI agents, and designing cloud-native systems.

What changed? Everything.

But the passion for building smart, scalable, and meaningful tech solutions stayed the same.

 In the first edition, I talk about: 
 ✅ My tech evolution from Java to Spring Boot
